## Freelance Resume Using gh_pages

Welcome to the repository for my freelance resume. This repository was forked from @jglovier.

Quick intro of myself...

My name's Vic an engineering student and wannabe __app developer__; I'm an avid gamer, i have always been fascinated with how games like _COD mobile_, _PUBG_, _PES21_, _Godofwar_ and other captivating games are built to be so entertaining and flawlessly functional, i thought to myself i will like to do something of sort so i decided to learn coding.

So far I have experience in HTML, CSS and Python currently learning javascript and C++; I’m available for any collaboration on any related projects and challenges. __Learning is one of my hobbies__ :slightly_smiling_face:

This template is using the :sparkles: open source project [resume-template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template). In some cases i’ve made changes to the data so it would suit my use, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
